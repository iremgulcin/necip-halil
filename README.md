## Overview

This project aims to revolutionize forest fire detection by developing a real-time algorithm using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery. Leveraging the power of deep learning, our approach integrates cutting-edge technology to address the limitations of existing systems.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Detection:** Utilizing the YOLOv8 model for fast and accurate object detection.
- **Feature Engineering:** Incorporating smoke detection, wind direction analysis, and fire location prediction.
- **Dataset:** High-resolution images obtained from TB-2 UAVs operated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.
- **Exploratory Data Analytics:** In-depth analysis of forest fire causes based on academic publications and expert insights.

## Objectives

1. Develop a real-time forest fire detection algorithm.
2. Address limitations in existing detection systems.
3. Contribute to the prevention and control of forest fires.

## Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Alignment

- **SDG 13: Climate Action:** Mitigating the impact of forest fires to reduce carbon emissions.
- **SDG 15: Life on Land:** Protecting terrestrial ecosystems through effective forest fire prevention.
